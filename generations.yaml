  - name: "First Generation (Mokka A)"

    description: "The first-generation Vauxhall/Opel Mokka was introduced as the brand's entry into the rapidly growing subcompact crossover segment, developed under General Motors ownership and sharing its Gamma II platform with other GM small vehicles including the Chevrolet Trax. Featuring a relatively boxy, upright design with traditional SUV styling cues including pronounced wheel arches, skid plates, and roof rails, the original Mokka combined compact exterior dimensions suitable for urban environments with a higher riding position appealing to buyers seeking an SUV-like experience in a smaller package. Engine options varied by market but typically included 1.4 and 1.6-liter petrol engines and 1.6 and 1.7-liter diesel units, with power outputs ranging from approximately 115 to 140 horsepower, paired with manual or automatic transmissions. While front-wheel drive was standard, all-wheel drive was available on select variants—an unusual feature for the segment at that time. The interior featured a somewhat cluttered dashboard design with numerous buttons and controls, though offering good visibility and a relatively high seating position. Technology included a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system, available navigation, and safety features like a rearview camera and blind-spot monitoring on higher trims. A facelift in 2016 renamed the model Mokka X in most markets, bringing refreshed styling with a more horizontal front-end design, an updated interior with reduced button count, and enhanced technology. While not the most refined or dynamically accomplished vehicle in its class, the first-generation Mokka achieved strong sales success by arriving early in the booming small crossover segment, offering the practicality, higher seating position, and SUV styling that increasingly appealed to European consumers, establishing Vauxhall/Opel as a significant player in this growing market."

  - name: "Second Generation (Mokka B)"

    end_year: null
    description: "The second-generation Vauxhall/Opel Mokka represents a radical departure from its predecessor, developed under PSA Group (now Stellantis) ownership after the acquisition of Vauxhall/Opel from General Motors. Built on the Stellantis CMP (Common Modular Platform) architecture shared with vehicles like the Peugeot 2008, the new Mokka features a bold, distinctive design introducing Vauxhall/Opel's new 'Vizor' front end—a blacked-out panel spanning the width of the vehicle incorporating headlights and brand logo. Marginally shorter but wider than its predecessor, the Mokka presents more dynamic proportions with a strong character line along the sides, available two-tone roof, and a more expressive overall aesthetic that significantly distinguishes it from the more conventional first generation. Powertrain options reflect Stellantis's diversified approach, including 1.2-liter three-cylinder turbocharged petrol engines with either 100 or 130 horsepower, a 1.5-liter diesel producing 110 horsepower, and most significantly, a fully electric Mokka-e (later renamed Mokka Electric) variant featuring a 136 horsepower electric motor and 50 kWh battery providing approximately 209 miles (338 km) of WLTP-rated range. All versions are front-wheel drive only, with no all-wheel drive option offered. The interior represents a complete redesign with the Pure Panel digital cockpit combining dual widescreens (up to 12 inches combined) for instruments and infotainment, creating a minimalist, high-tech environment with physical controls limited to essential functions. Advanced driver assistance systems include adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, and lane-keeping assistance. The second-generation Mokka emphasizes design and technology over maximum practicality, with slightly reduced interior space compared to some competitors, targeting a more style-conscious urban buyer. This generation plays a key role in Vauxhall/Opel's repositioning under Stellantis ownership, demonstrating the brand's new design language and commitment to electrification while maintaining a presence in the crucial compact crossover segment."
