    description: "The first-generation Vauxhall/Opel Mokka was introduced as the brand's entry into the rapidly growing subcompact crossover segment, developed under General Motors ownership and sharing its Gamma II platform with other GM small vehicles including the Chevrolet Trax. Featuring a relatively boxy, upright design with traditional SUV styling cues including pronounced wheel arches, skid plates, and roof rails, the original Mokka combined compact exterior dimensions suitable for urban environments with a higher riding position appealing to buyers seeking an SUV-like experience in a smaller package. Engine options varied by market but typically included 1.4 and 1.6-liter petrol engines and 1.6 and 1.7-liter diesel units, with power outputs ranging from approximately 115 to 140 horsepower, paired with manual or automatic transmissions. While front-wheel drive was standard, all-wheel drive was available on select variants—an unusual feature for the segment at that time. The interior featured a somewhat cluttered dashboard design with numerous buttons and controls, though offering good visibility and a relatively high seating position. Technology included a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system, available navigation, and safety features like a rearview camera and blind-spot monitoring on higher trims."

    start_year: 2016
    end_year: 2019
    description: "The first-generation Mokka received a significant mid-cycle refresh in April 2016, marketed as the Mokka X for model year 2017. The facelift introduced new headlights with LED daytime running lights, restyled bumpers with a more horizontal front-end design, new LED tail lights, and a completely redesigned interior featuring an all-new dashboard, instrument cluster, and centre stack with reduced button count. A more powerful 1.4-liter direct injection turbo petrol engine (B14XFT) was introduced with the facelift. The updated model maintained the same GM Gamma II platform and mechanicals while offering enhanced technology and a more refined appearance. The Mokka X continued to offer both front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive configurations, along with the same range of petrol and diesel engines including the new 1.6-liter CDTI diesel that replaced the older 1.7-liter unit."

    description: "The second-generation Vauxhall/Opel Mokka represents a radical departure from its predecessor, developed under PSA Group (now Stellantis) ownership after the acquisition of Vauxhall/Opel from General Motors. Built on the Stellantis CMP (Common Modular Platform) architecture shared with vehicles like the Peugeot 2008, the new Mokka features a bold, distinctive design introducing Vauxhall/Opel's new 'Vizor' front end—a blacked-out panel spanning the width of the vehicle incorporating headlights and brand logo. Marginally shorter but wider than its predecessor, the Mokka presents more dynamic proportions with a strong character line along the sides, available two-tone roof, and a more expressive overall aesthetic that significantly distinguishes it from the more conventional first generation. Powertrain options reflect Stellantis's diversified approach, including 1.2-liter three-cylinder turbocharged petrol engines with either 100 or 130 horsepower, a 1.5-liter diesel producing 110 horsepower, and most significantly, a fully electric Mokka-e (later renamed Mokka Electric) variant featuring a 136 horsepower electric motor and 50 kWh battery providing approximately 209 miles (338 km) of WLTP-rated range. All versions are front-wheel drive only, with no all-wheel drive option offered. The interior represents a complete redesign with the Pure Panel digital cockpit combining dual widescreens (up to 12 inches combined) for instruments and infotainment, creating a minimalist, high-tech environment with physical controls limited to essential functions. Advanced driver assistance systems include adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, and lane-keeping assistance."
